# Maze Generator and Solver 🎲🚀

An interactive visualization tool developed using **Python** and **Pygame** to demonstrate the working of **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms. This tool lets users generate random mazes, solve them with visual representation, adjust the speed, and explore how the algorithms work in real-time. 🧩✨

## Features 🎯
- Generate random mazes 🏗️
- Solve the mazes using **BFS** 🧠 and **DFS** 🔍
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - **Maze Generation**: Create random mazes with one click.
  - **Solve Maze**: Choose between BFS and DFS for solving.
  - **Speed Control**: Adjustable solving speed ranging from **10ms to 100ms+** 🏃‍♂️💨
  - **Reset**: Clear the current maze and start fresh.
  - **Stop/Restart**: Pause or restart the solving process.
- **Visual Representation** of the solving process 🎨:
  - 🟧 **Orange**: Frontier nodes (nodes to be explored)
  - 🟪 **Purple**: Explored nodes
  - 🟥 **Red**: Solution path
  - 🟩 **Green**: Start point
  - 🟦 **Blue**: End point
- Smooth performance at **60 FPS** for seamless interaction ⚡

## Tech Stack 💻
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pygame** 🎮

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Generate Maze**: A random maze is generated using DFS.
2. **Solve Maze**: The maze can be solved using either BFS or DFS.
3. **Interactive Speed Control**: Adjust the path exploration speed between **10ms to 100ms+** while visualizing the algorithm in real-time.
4. **Visual Cues**: The path exploration is represented with distinct colors for easy understanding.
5. **Smooth Performance**: The tool runs at **60 FPS** to ensure smooth transitions and interactions even when solving complex mazes.

## File Structure 🗂️
