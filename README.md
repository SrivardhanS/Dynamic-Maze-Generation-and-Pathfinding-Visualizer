# Maze Generator and Solver 🎲🚀

An interactive visualization tool developed using **Python** and **Pygame** to demonstrate the working of **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms. This tool lets users generate random mazes, solve them with visual representation, adjust the speed, and explore how the algorithms work in real-time. 🧩✨

## Features 🎯
- Generate random mazes 🏗️
- Solve the mazes using **BFS** 🧠 and **DFS** 🔍
- Adjust the speed of the solving process 🏃‍♂️💨
- Visual representation of the solving process 🎨
- Simple UI for easy interaction 🖱️

## Tech Stack 💻
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pygame** 🎮

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Generate Maze**: A random maze is generated using DFS.
2. **Solve Maze**: Maze is solved using BFS.
3. **Speed Control**: You can adjust the path exploration speed while visualizing the algorithm.
4. **Visual Cues**: The path exploration is visually represented with colors:
    - 🟧 **Orange**: Frontier nodes (nodes to be explored)
    - 🟪 **Purple**: Explored nodes
    - 🟥 **Red**: Solution path
    - 🟩 **Green**: Start point
    - 🟦 **Blue**: End point
5. Maze2.0.py has the latest code.
